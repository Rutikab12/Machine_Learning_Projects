     <ul>
      <li>Task-1: Predict the percentage of student if he studies for 9.25hours/day.</li>
      <li>Task-2: From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
    and represent it visually. </li>
      <li>Task-3: Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
     As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can
    work to make more profit.
     What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? </li>
      <li>Task-4: Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
    The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
    predict the right class accordingly.</li>
